# QEP We Solve It!

> Real-World Problem Solving: School Shootings in America. 

## Summary 

This project is my submission to the 2018 [*QEP we solve it!*](https://aa.columbusstate.edu/sacs/qep/what-is-a-qep.php) competition at Columbus State University. The whole point of this competition was to allow students to preform independent research on a "real-world" problem and how it might be solved. Each student was given a different problem and had to use their major as the focal point on how this problem could be solved. Their solution and research on the topic is presented before the QEP committee for evolution. The problem topic gets decided by the QEP committee, my topic was to "Solve gun violence in America". I decided to focus on a subset of this topic by looking at School Shootings specially.  

The code that is accompanying this project was created to simply show off the idea. This application/product should not be seen as a final product nor is it pitched as such. I just simply wanted a little staged demo to show the QEP committee how a system like this might work. The focus of this competition is mostly aimed at the research angle not a final product. 

#### Proposed Solution

The main philosophy behind the solution is the **need for a preemptive solution** instead of a reactive solution that is currently in place at most schools. Because school shootings happen in such a short period, you need something that gets out ahead of the problem instead of waiting around for it to happen. 

The solution is largely made up of two parts:

- Putting a key card system on each door way so that way only issued students and visitors can enter the school
- taking data about the 'traffic' of each building and sending that off to the school police force. This way they can have a better informed decision on where to send officers to patrol depending on number of students in a given building. 

This solution combines the key points of keeping costs down, being a preemptive barrier to threats, and assisting the already in place system being the on campus police force. 

#### Research Conducted

The research I conducted to arrive at the current solution are in two parts. **Looking at School shootings of the past** and **seeing the weakness of my schools current system**

###### Looking at School Shootings of the past
How did these shootings happen? Did they cover a lot of ground? Could this have been prevented with some pre planning? Are the main question I tried to answer at each of the school shooting events I looked at.

###### Seeing the weakness of my schools current system
Here I ask a friend of mine to pretty much walk around the school with a duffel bag. This would simulate a 'active shooter' for the sake of first-hand research.  This experiment showed us a couple of key problems.

- People who are not allowed on the school grounds can clearly show up with no problems
- He was able to enter any of the school buildings
- During areas of a high mass an of students, there was no safe guard protection for the student population. 
- During this hour long experiment, he was able to cover teh whole school ground and only encounter one officer. 

## QEP Competition

During the competition, all students went over there research with a poster presentation. After the competition was over, I received first place in the competition. This award came with a scholarship for books in the next semester.

#### Competition Documents
here are some documents I presented during the competition

- [Presentation](resources/presentation.flv)
- [Power Point](resources/power_point.pptx)
- [Poster](resources/poster.pdf)
- [Project Proposal](resources/project%20proposal.odt)
- [We Solve It Report](resources/We%20Solve%20It%20Report.doc)
- [Class Diagram](resources/Class%20diagram.doc)

#### Feedback from Competition
During the competition received some feedback on my proposed solution as of course no solution is perfect. The two main criticisms are:

- Gun owner's could feel targeted
- Any information kept on gun owners is unlawful

This feedback from gun owners pushed the focuses of the solution into a system where data on an individual is not kept and the only "metadata" is stored. 

## Current Status

The project never made it out of the proposal stage. The school elected to turn down further funding on work towards a final product. 

#### Moving Forward

Based on the feedback received from the school and the QEP committee, the project would take the following turn. It would shift to more of a cost effective and metadata approach. Meaning that any security guard aspect is cut and all the data that is tracked by the system doesn't relay any student or personal information.  

Making this project into an actual product, The following resources would be needed:

- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)
    - This unit would be each door to allow the processing of checking RFID cards and to send off traffic data to a 'dispatcher' node
- [RFID Reader](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-RFID-Kit-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B01CSTW0IA/ref=pd_nav_b2b_ab_bia_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=AGHDVNWJFMX6NN115FKS)
    - This would make sure that the user is allowed to enter this door

Naturally, The code above as it currently stands (10-21-2020) would not work moving forward. A massive restructuring  of the project would take place, but the work done in the research gives the development a focal lens on how to be built.
